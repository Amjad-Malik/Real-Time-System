\begin{abstract}
Several techniques and methodologies have been proposed in recent years to enhance the predictability of real-time systems for the better. Constant Bandwidth Server, usually known as CBS, is one of the scheduling systems discussed in this paper. In real-time systems with variable execution requirements, this scheduling strategy is widely used to manage overruns by implementing a strategy to reserve the resources. Various service mechanisms are established and provided in particular to lower the average response time of aperiodic requests while maintaining the scheduling sequence of hard periodic jobs. To illustrate these findings, we must first examine and expound on several fundamental notions that will be employed throughout this study.
